        <p>
            1.Obviously, true.<br>
            2.Dictionary comparison, hence false. "a" is smaller than "p".<br>
            3.Again, dictionary comparison, first char "2" is greater than the first char "1".<br>
            4.Values null and undefined equal each other only.<br>
            5.Strict equality is strict. Different types from both sides lead to false.<br>
            6.Similar to (4), null only equals undefined.<br>
            7.Strict equality of different types.
