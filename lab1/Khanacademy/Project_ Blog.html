        <h2 id= "ALA-link">Almaty In Danger</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 27th Jan 2026</h6>
        
        <p id= 'first-blog' >Almaty is a city surrounded by mountains, full of greenery and vibrant culture. Yet behind this beauty lies a serious issue: the air is often polluted. Especially in winter, when heating season begins and the wind is too weak to disperse the smog, a heavy gray blanket hangs over the city.<br>
On the streets, you can smell smoke, and visibility drops because of the haze. Residents complain of coughing, fatigue, and headaches — all signs of breathing unhealthy air.<br>
The reasons are clear: too many cars, outdated heating systems, and the city’s geography — sitting in a valley where pollution gets trapped.<br>
More and more people in Almaty are talking about change: using public transport, supporting eco-initiatives, and demanding real solutions from authorities. Because Almaty deserves clean air just as much as any modern city.</p>
    
    <h2 id= "AST-link">LRT in Astana</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 28th Jan 2026</h6>
        
        <p id= 'second-blog' >Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, has long dreamed of modern public transport solutions. One of the most talked-about projects is the LRT (Light Rail Transit). Initially envisioned as a sleek, futuristic system to ease traffic and connect key parts of the city, the project has instead become a symbol of delays and controversy.<br>Construction started years ago, but progress has been slow. Many residents see unfinished pillars and empty tracks as reminders of wasted potential.<br>The idea behind the LRT was strong: reduce car dependency, cut pollution, and give Astana a world-class transport option. Yet the reality has been different — funding issues, management problems, and shifting priorities have left the project in limbo.<br>
People in Astana often joke that the LRT is more of a monument than a transport system. Still, there’s hope that one day the project will be revived and finally serve its purpose: moving thousands of passengers efficiently across the capital.</p>
