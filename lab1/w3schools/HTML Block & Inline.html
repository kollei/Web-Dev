<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

/* Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples of inline elements are: <span style="border: 1px solid black">span</span>, <a href="#" style="border: 1px solid black">a</a>, and <strong style="border: 1px solid black">strong</strong>. */
<span>Hello World</span>
